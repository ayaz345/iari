# Investigations

## Citation generation helpers services and scripts

These scripts and services play a central role in
generating valid CS1 templates to be inserted on (English) Wikipedia

Some of them were supported by grants.

### [Citoid](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21679984)

Mediawiki extension. This is already the default in the visual editor.

### [Web2cit](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115473545) (launched in september 2022)

This is not the default but way more accurate and customizable than citoid it seems.
It was made by Diego de la hara who seems competent at writing JavaScript and got a grant
for creating Web2Cit in 2022
It currently has
[only 11 active users on English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_scripts/Most_imported_scripts)
which is surprisingly few.

### Proveit

ProveIt (/ˈpruːvɪt/) is a gadget that makes it easy to find, edit, add, and cite
references when editing Wikipedia articles. Referencing is a key task at Wikipedia,
but the process is often difficult because the citation templates (such as
Template:Cite book) are complex. ProveIt simplifies the process by adding a smart
and simple graphical user interface when editing any article. You deal with the interface,
and ProveIt deals with the wikitext.

## [Citation expander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_expander)
Gadget in english wikipedia that enables expansion of citation templates.
TODO try it out.
